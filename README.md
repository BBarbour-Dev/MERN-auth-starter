# Get Started

1. In your terminal use the command `npm install` to install the server modules.
2. `cd client` and run `npm install` to install the React client-side modules.
3. Navigate to `config/env`to see which `.env` vars you need to run the server in development or production.
4. Create your own `.env` file in the root directory. Add the required variables.
5. Use the command `npm run dev` if in development or `npm run start` if in production.
